        This dashboard is a visualzing human milk components from NeoBANK samples.  
        </p>
        <p>
        With only 34 subjects in this dataset, results are preliminary â€” but the goal is to show the 
        <strong>possibilities</strong>:  
        <ul>
            <li>Defining human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) composition </li>
            <li>Visualizing how HMOs may support individualized nutrition</li>
            <li>Identifying trends in NICU settings</li>
        </ul>
